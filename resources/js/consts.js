        story: "This is a story of a young woman called Julia and a redwood tree. She couldn't bear to watch the lumber company cut down the redwoods. She climbed a 1,000-year-old sequoia tree named Luna to protect it from a logging company. She stayed in the tree canopy for two years. With the help of activists on the ground, she withstood freezing rain, strong winds, and intimidation by security guards and loggers. She gave interviews to the media directly from the treetop. Only when the company agreed to save the tree and the surrounding area did Julia climb down.",
